		<h1>Protocols</h1>
		<p>how to continue the communication, and how to end the communication. Similarly, in a telephone conversation, there
		are a set of rules that we need to follow. There is a rule how to make connection (dialing the telephone number), how to respond to the call (picking up the receiver), how to
		greet, how to let the communication flow smoothly by listening when the other party is
		talking, and finally how to end the communication (hanging up).</p> 
		<p>In <span>computer networks</span>, how it is communicated, and when it is communicated. The key elements of a protocol are syntax, semantics, and timing.
